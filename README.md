# Advent of Code 2022

This GitHub repository contains the solutions for the 2022 Advent of Code challenge. The solutions are implemented using Camel Spring Boot and jbang. Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge that takes place in the lead up to Christmas. It consists of a series of puzzles that are released each day in the month of December. These solutions use Camel Spring Boot, a Java-based framework for developing applications based on the Spring Framework, and jbang, a command-line tool for running Java code without the need for a full-fledged Java project. Together, these technologies allow for efficient and elegant solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles.
